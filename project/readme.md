# Vector-Editor üñäÔ∏è
## A text-base vector drawing editor

This is a repository containing all the files for Vector-Editor, a small C vector drawing software.

As of now, the whole project is developed using the CLion IDE. To run the program inside a terminal,
open a new command prompt, use the `cd <path>` command to change the active directory to the project's 
`cmake-build-debug` one, and then run the `.exe` file :
`C:\Users\matte\CLionProjects\vector-editor\cmake-build-debug>vector_editor.exe`
